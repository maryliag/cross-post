Slack App for cross posting messages to a different channel.

When someone asks a question on a channel, but that was not the right channel to ask, 
someone might share the message to another channel, but some people might reply to the original thread while
others might reply on the shared one, causing a misalignment in communication.

This Slack App was created to help this problem. The message is shared to the new
channel and a message on the original thread is sent to indicated to where the conversation was
moved to and where it should continue.

##Usage
- Click on `More Actions` on the message you want to share (you don't have to be the author)

- Select the channel you want to share and add any new info if you want

- The Message will show up on the new channel
